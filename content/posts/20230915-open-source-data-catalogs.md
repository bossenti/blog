<br>

We are excited to announce that a blog post we have been working on for the past few months has just gone live! In this
post, my colleague and I have written an extensive comparison of open-source data catalogs. We provide a practitioner's
view on the catalogs, going beyond just comparing feature promises from the documentation. We hope you find it
informative and useful. Please feel free to give it a read and let us know your thoughts!

Find the full blog post [here](https://www.inovex.de/de/blog/data-observability-is-key-a-hands-on-comparison-of-open-source-data-catalog-tools/) and enjoy the read! ✌️
