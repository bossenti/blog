**It's all about metadata ðŸ¤“**

A few years ago,I came across [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/)  when I was on the lookout for an open-source data catalog.
Since then I'm actively enganging with the DataHub community and currently volunteering as a [community champion](https://datahubproject.io/champions).

This section of my blog is dedicated to sharing everything I've learned and discovered while working with DataHub and engaging with the community. You'll find a collection of tips, best practices, demos, and technical deep dives.

DataHub is a powerful open-source metadata platform that helps organizations manage their data assets efficiently. Whether you're just getting started with DataHub or looking to optimize your existing setup, this blog has you covered.

Please find all posts about DataHub [here](../tags/datahub).
