**Welcome to my blog! ðŸ‘‹**

Hey there! I'm Tim, my passion lies in the intersection of software engineering, cloud technologies, data platform
engineering, and DataOps. I'm always on the lookout for innovative ways to leverage data and drive meaningful insights.

When I'm not deep in the trenches of data engineering, you'll find me contributing to the Open Source community. I'm an
active contributor to projects like [Apache StreamPipes](https://streampipes.apache.org/) and [DataHub](https://datahubproject.io/), among others. Collaborating with the global tech
community keeps me inspired and up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies.
